Hi, I'm Frederick. I am currently a biomaterials research associate in the Department of Comprehensive Dentistry at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.

My research focuses on developing and characterizing composite materials with antimicrobial properties to fight off biofilm. Prior approaches employed the use of silver nanoparticles, but this shifted as it struggled to mitigate its associated genotoxicity. Now, current methods are exploring K18 quaternary ammonium silane, commonly found as an additive in hand sanitizers and mouthwash.

Before this, I earned my B. S. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and North Carolina State University, where I was an engineering intern at UNC Health's Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Abrams Research Scholar at UNC's Chemical Research Instrumentation Teaching and Core Labs.
