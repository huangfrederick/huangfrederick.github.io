Hi, I'm Frederick. I am currently a biomaterials research associate in the <a href="https://uthscsa.edu/dental/departments/comprehensive-dentistry">Department of Comprehensive Dentistry</a> at the <a href="https://uthscsa.edu">University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio</a>.
  
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My research focuses on the surface chemistry of composite materials with antimicrobial properties, developed and characterized with the purpose of preventing biofilm anchoring and growth on dental tissue. Current methods are exploring the use of K18 quaternary ammonium silane, an additive commonly found in hand sanitizers and mouthwash.

I studied Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry at the <a href = "https://bme.unc.edu">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and North Carolina State University</a>. There, I was previously an engineering intern at <a href = "https://www.med.unc.edu/phyrehab/">UNC Health's Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation</a> and Abrams Research Scholar as part of UNC's <a href = "https://chem.unc.edu/critcl-main/">Chemical Research Instrumentation Teaching and Core Labs</a>.
