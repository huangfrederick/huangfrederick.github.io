Hi, I'm Frederick. I am currently a biomaterials research associate in the <a href="https://uthscsa.edu/dental/departments/comprehensive-dentistry">Department of Comprehensive Dentistry</a> at the <a href="https://uthscsa.edu">University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio</a>.
  
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My research focuses on developing and characterizing composite materials with antimicrobial surface properties to prevent biofilm anchoring. Prior approaches employed the use of silver nanoparticles, but this shifted as it struggled to mitigate its associated genotoxicity upon wear. Now, current methods are exploring K18 quaternary ammonium silane, an additive commonly found in hand sanitizers and mouthwash.

I studied Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry at the <a href = "https://bme.unc.edu">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and North Carolina State University</a>. There, I was previously an engineering intern at <a href = "https://www.med.unc.edu/phyrehab/">UNC Health's Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation</a> and Abrams Research Scholar as part of UNC's <a href = "https://chem.unc.edu/critcl-main/">Chemical Research Instrumentation Teaching and Core Labs</a>.
