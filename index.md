Hi, I'm Frederick. I am currently a biomaterials research associate in the <a href="https://uthscsa.edu/dental/departments/comprehensive-dentistry">Department of Comprehensive Dentistry</a> at the <a href="https://uthscsa.edu">University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio</a>.
  
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My research focuses on the surface chemistry and mechanics of composite materials with antimicrobial properties, developed and characterized with the purpose of preventing biofilm growth. Current methods are exploring the use of <a href = "https://fitebacdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FiteBac-Chemical-K18-Biocompatibility-Letter-x4-EO.pdf"> quaternary ammonium compounds</a>, a class of molecules found in products like <a href = "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10210541/">hand sanitizers and algaecides</a>.

</p>



<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I studied Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry at the <a href = "https://bme.unc.edu">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and North Carolina State University</a>. There, I was previously an engineering intern at <a href = "https://www.med.unc.edu/phyrehab/">UNC Health's Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation</a> and Abrams Research Scholar as part of UNC's <a href = "https://chem.unc.edu/critcl-main/">Chemical Research Instrumentation Teaching and Core Labs</a>.
