    description: >-
      This project develops a wireless controller to help medical students navigate
      Anki flashcards during their preclinical training and USMLE preparation. With
      the rapid growth of medical knowledge and the heavy reliance on spaced-repetition
      tools like Anki, what’s better than yearning for flashcards even when away from
      your computer? Inspired by compact devices such as the 8bitdo Zero 2, the project
      examines ECE topics in power regulation, RF communication, and hardware design.
      See <a href="https://github.com/huangfrederick/Anki-Remote-Controller">here</a>
      for schematics and source code.

    description: >-
      Reaction time (RT) is a common tool for diagnosing mild traumatic brain injury
      (mTBI), assessed with visual stimuli on a screen and responses via mouse or keyboard.
      While <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289613000470">past studies</a>
      reported declining human RTs over the last 150 years, recent publications suggest these findings
      may be confounded by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509091/full?utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Human_Neuroscience&id=509091#B75">operating system–level latencies</a>
      meant for user precision. Here, dedicated hardware for measuring reaction time to minimize such
      errors was developed. Schematics, source code, and a writing sample can be found

  - title: Quality Assurance and Control in Biospecimens

      src: "/assets/biospecimens.png"
    description: >-
      Unlike DNA, RNA, and proteins, lipids and metabolic products lack a standardized integrity metric
      for quality control in omics research. This R21 project explored how extraction methods affect
      phospholipid stability, comparing sonication vs. vortexing and vacuum vs. N₂ gas drying. Vortex
      mixing and N₂ drying emerged as the most reliable approaches, laying groundwork for SOPs in
      future work with neurological applications. Further development will define a lipidomic integrity
      number and build upon Matyash extractions with a penta-omic method.

  - title: Pectus Carinatum Monitoring and Data Collection

    description: >-
      Pectus carinatum (“pigeon chest”) is a congenital deformity treated primarily with compression
      braces (or surgery in more extreme cases) requiring 12–18 months of therapy and frequent manual
      recalibration during adolescence to maintain an optimal pressure between 1–3 psi, despite a
      nominal 9 month timeline. This project applied a systems-level engineering approach to improve
      upon status quo by developing a system that: (1) monitors brace pressure in real time and (2)
      allows on-the-fly adjustments. Integrating sensors and feedback mechanisms, the design streamlined
      the clinical process and reduced treatment variability to enhance patient outcomes.

  - title: Insulin Analogs—Ultra Stable, Single Chain, and Rapid Acting?
    image:
      src: "/assets/InsulinReceptor.png"
    description: >-
      A major challenge in insulin accessibility in resource-poor settings has been its dependence on
      a cold chain. While its pharmacological properties are well studied, only recent advances have
      produced a thermally stable wildtype analog effective at room temperature. Inspired by natural
      evolution, this project utilized computational simulations to predict candidate molecules.
      Structural features of venom from fish-hunting cone snails, c. geographus, were integrated into
      the stable insulin analog with aims to modulate its pharmacokinetic profile.
