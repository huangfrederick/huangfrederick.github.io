    description: This project develops a wireless controller to help medical students navigate Anki flashcards during their preclinical training and USMLE preparation. With the rapid growth of medical knowledge and the heavy reliance on spaced-repetition tools like Anki, what’s better than yearning for flashcards even when away from your computer? Inspired by compact devices such as the 8bitdo Zero 2, the project examines ECE topics in power regulation, RF communication, and hardware design. See <a href="https://github.com/huangfrederick/Anki-Remote-Controller"> here</a> for schematics and source code.
  - title: Reaction Time Datalogger

    description: Reaction time (RT) is a common tool for diagnosing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), assessed with visual stimuli on a screen and responses via mouse or keyboard. While past studies reported declining human RTs over the last 150 years, recent evidence suggests these findings may be confounded by operating system–level delays meant for user precision. Here, dedicated hardware for measuring reaction time to minimize such errors was developed. Schematics, source code, and a writing sample can be found <a href="https://github.com/huangfrederick/Reaction-Time-Datalogger">here</a>.
